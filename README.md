# CAPP Camp Python Lab

The goal of this lab is to help you become more comfortable with working with Python.

Since you are not expected to know how to write Python at this point this can feel challenging, but for this lab focus on what we've covered and feel free to discuss with peers.

In this lab you will be trying to get a program running.

## Tips

- The focus of this lab is on the workflow we discussed: run the code, see an error, diagnose & fix, repeat.
- Remember, the '#' character is a comment. You'll notice VSCode colors everything after that on a line line differently. Code following a '#' is not run.
- Try to do this without relying too much on external resources or tools, you of course can and will use those in the future, but for today- practice with what is in front of you.
- Feel free to experiment and make changes to the code to better understand it!

## Part 1

Fixing Typos

## Part 2

## Part 3

This portion may feel like a bit of a stretch if you have never written code before, don't worry if that's the case for you & your partner.

When you run the program now, you do not get any errors, but you will find that it still does not behave as expected.

## Submission

We ask that you submit the assignment to Gradescope at the end, this will both give you practice with Gradescope and help us see how people fared (strictly for the purposes of revising this assignment for future camps).
